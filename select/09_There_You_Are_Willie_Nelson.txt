It might be in the middle of the afternoon,
Maybe somewhere in the middle of night
I might not be thinking anything at all
And a perfect stranger's face
Catches a certain light
And my heart jumps
'cause all at once
There you are
Standing right in front of me
There you are
As lovely as you'll always be
And Here I go
Back into those memories
Where you are
Still in love with me.
I know I'll never hold you in my arms again
I know I'll never hear you speak my name.
I look around this lonely room and I can see
Your memory's the only thing that hasn't changed
I close my eyes
And every time
There you are
Standing right in front of me.
There you are
As lovely as you'll always be
And here I go
Back into those memories
Where you are
Still in love with me.
Where you are
Still in love with me
