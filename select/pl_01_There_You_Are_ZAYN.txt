Only you know me
The way you know me
Only you forgive me
When I'm sorry
Need you when I'm broken
When I'm fixed
Need you when I'm well
And when I'm sick
Friends that I rely on Don't come through
They run like the river
But not you
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
Whispers in the background
Behind closed doors
I got myself in a mess and Without you I'm in
more Oh, I'm a little drunk now That's why I
went to war Oh yeah, you are my sober When I'm
on the floor
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are
Need you when I'm hot And when I'm cold
Need you when I'm young
When I'm old
You won't be far
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when 1 messed it up
There you are
(Need you when I'm, need you when I'm) (Need you
when I'm, need you when I'm)
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
When you're caught in the crowds When you're up
in the clouds
There you are
