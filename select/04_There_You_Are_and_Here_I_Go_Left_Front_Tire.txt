As I lay here in the bed, the ceiling spins aroung my head.
What do you do when you can't close your eyes?
My body starts to compromise.
A tear from my eye a thought from my mind and she's all been left behind.
There you are and here I go.
Feelings are there but they're hard to show.
Who's to say what the future holds... there you are and here I go.
We both have dreams but who's to say that both can't come our way.
I'm on the road, you're sitting at home but I think of you anyway.
Maybe I'm wrong and maybe you're right.
Why don't we make the most of the night.
