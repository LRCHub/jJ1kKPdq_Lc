Here I am
Caught in the moment
Seems to be frozen
Lost in the silence you left behind
And i turn on the light so you find the way home
And I open the windows and stare at the phone
I'm alone, try to sleep

There you are
Seems like we've not been apart
I can't believe that you left me alone
Then you found your way home
There you are
Won't you stay
Stay when the night turns to day

Here I am
I turn on the TV
Wish you were near me
Still can't believe it
You're gone
So I turn on the stereo like you used to do
I put on your shirt and I spray your perfume
I'm alone, fall asleep

Won't you stay
Stay forever
Stay through the good times, the bad times
The rain and the sunshine
So I won't have to wake up and find that you're gone

There you are
Seems like we've not been apart
I can't believe that you left me alone
Then you found your way home
There you are
I knew I wouldfind you, my star
I can't beleive that you left me alone
Then you found your way home
There you are
Won't you stay
Stay when the night turnes to day
